We developed our frontend with the following technologies:

- React
- Redux
- Axios

## ‚ú® Code Standards

We also have here some git hooks. Please do a npm prepare and then the formatter and the linter are good to go. We use eslint and prettier to keep our code tidy

## üêõ Debugging

### React Debug Tool

React provides a debug tool, which you can download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=de)

### Redux Debug Tool

Redux also provides a debug tool, to debug the actions and states [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=de)

### REST API

Our Rest API is documented with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and [ReDoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/). After you
start up LibrePhotos you can find them under:

```
localhost:3000/api/swagger
```

```
localhost:3000/api/redoc
```

## üèôÔ∏è Structure

- You can find all the routes in [App.js](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/blob/dev/src/App.js).
- The pages are in [layouts](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/layouts)
- Pages should be split up into React Components, which you can find in
  [components](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/components)
- The API calls are made into split into actions, which you can find in
  [actions](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/actions)
- To handle the state for the whole page we use redux. You can find the states and reducers in
  [reducers](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/reducers)
- [api_client](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/api_client) is just a simple axios
  client
- In [util](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/util) you can find miscellaneous functions.

## To-Do

You can look into the issues [here](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afrontend),
on what features are missing from the frontend.

We currently are working on improving maintainability, by converting our code base to TypeScript.

You can also work on other issues. Most of the files are too large and should be under 300 lines of code. To achieve that we can do multiple things:

- The layouts should be split into components
- Functions that are used in multiple classes should be moved into utils
- One file should only contain one class

It would also be great if we could introduce some
[test coverage and automated testing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/).
